# Wine_quality_prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify wines into different quality categories based on various chemical and sensory attributes.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will use a dataset containing information about wines, including their chemical properties and a quality rating. By building a predictive model, we aim to help winemakers and wine enthusiasts assess and improve wine quality.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in the `data` directory and is named `wine_quality.csv`. This dataset contains features like acidity, alcohol content, and pH, along with a quality score for each wine sample. You can download and use your own dataset if needed.
